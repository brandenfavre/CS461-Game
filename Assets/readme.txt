The procedural generation for my dungeon that I’ve done is based off of this person’s implementation:

(Erik Overflow: Unity2D - Efficient Procedural Dungeon Generation)
I like it a lot because it’s a lot simpler (with its limitations as well) compared to a lot of other implementations I was researching. 
Though his original implementation lacked a lot of things that I wanted 
(Side walls, curved walls, enemy placement, decorations, player and exit positioning) so I added all of those.
The tiles that I’m using for my dungeon come from: 
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/rpg-worlds-caves-167274
(Szadi Art RPG Worlds Caves)
I don’t fully utilize the asset pack, as my dungeon looks pretty barebone compared to the screenshots on that page.

The enemy assets I'm using are from the same person:

It's still early on so it's kind of hard to work with, but also fun to use.
